# Handoff Skill

You are handing off the current task to another agent. Your job is to write a comprehensive handoff prompt and launch the agent via Paseo CLI.

**User's arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Prerequisites

Load the **Paseo skill** first — it contains the CLI reference for all agent commands.

## What Is a Handoff

A handoff transfers your current task — including all context, decisions, failed attempts, and constraints — to a fresh agent that will carry it to completion. The handoff prompt is the most important part: the receiving agent starts with **zero context**, so everything it needs must be in the prompt.

## Parsing Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine:

1. **Provider and model** — who to hand off to
2. **Worktree** — whether to run in an isolated git worktree
3. **Task description** — any additional context the user provided

### Provider Resolution

| User says | --provider | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| *(nothing)* | `codex/gpt-5.4` | `full-access` |
| `codex` | `codex/gpt-5.4` | `full-access` |
| `claude` | `claude/opus` | `bypass` |
| `opus` | `claude/opus` | `bypass` |
| `sonnet` | `claude/sonnet` | `bypass` |

Default is **Codex** with `gpt-5.4`.

### Worktree Resolution

If the user says "in a worktree" or "worktree", add `--worktree` with a short descriptive branch name derived from the task. Worktrees require a `--base` branch — use the current branch in the working directory (run `git branch --show-current` to get it).

## Writing the Handoff Prompt

This is the critical step. The receiving agent has **zero context** about your conversation. The handoff prompt must be a self-contained briefing document.

### Must Include

1. **Task description** — What needs to be done, in clear imperative language
2. **Task qualifiers** — Preserve the semantics of what the user asked for:
   - If the user asked to **investigate without editing**, say "DO NOT edit any files"
   - If the user asked to **fix**, say "implement the fix"
   - If the user asked to **refactor**, say "refactor" not "rewrite"
   - Carry forward the exact intent
3. **Relevant files** — List every file path that matters, with brief descriptions of what each contains
4. **Current state** — What has been done so far, what's working, what's not
5. **What was tried** — Any approaches attempted and why they failed or were abandoned
6. **Decisions made** — Anything you and the user agreed on (design choices, constraints, trade-offs)
7. **Acceptance criteria** — How the agent knows it's done
8. **Constraints** — Anything the agent must NOT do

### Template

```
## Task

[Clear, imperative description of what to do]

## Context

[Why this task exists, background the agent needs]

## Relevant Files

- `path/to/file.ts` — [what it does and why it matters]
- `path/to/other.ts` — [what it does and why it matters]

## Current State

[What's been done, what works, what doesn't]

## What Was Tried

- [Approach 1] — [why it failed/was abandoned]
- [Approach 2] — [partial success, but...]

## Decisions

- [Decision 1 — rationale]
- [Decision 2 — rationale]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]

## Constraints

- [Do not do X]
- [Must preserve Y]
```

## Launching the Agent

### Default (Codex, no worktree)

```bash
paseo run -d --mode full-access --provider codex/gpt-5.4 --name "[Handoff] Task description" "$prompt"
```

### Claude (Opus, no worktree)

```bash
paseo run -d --mode bypassPermissions --provider claude/opus --name "[Handoff] Task description" "$prompt"
```

### Codex in a worktree

```bash
base=$(git branch --show-current)
paseo run -d --mode full-access --provider codex/gpt-5.4 --worktree task-branch-name --base "$base" --name "[Handoff] Task description" "$prompt"
```

### Claude in a worktree

```bash
base=$(git branch --show-current)
paseo run -d --mode bypass --provider claude/opus --worktree task-branch-name --base "$base" --name "[Handoff] Task description" "$prompt"
```

## After Launch

1. Print the agent ID and the command to follow along:
   ```
   Handed off to [provider] ([model]). Agent ID: <id>
   Follow along: paseo logs <id> -f
   Wait for completion: paseo wait <id>
   ```
2. Do **not** wait for the agent by default — the user can choose to wait or move on.
3. If the user wants to wait, run `paseo wait <id>` and then `paseo logs <id>` when done.
