- don't add comments to the code unless there's something confusing or a hack you implement.
- Always keep the implementations and fixes clean, with good code practices and minimalistic. Never add additional complexity unless confirmed by the user or explicitly asked for.
- When writing TypeScript, never use `any` or typecasting unless instructed to do so.
- When writing TypeScript, don't use non-null assertion
